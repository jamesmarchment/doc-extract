# doc-extract
Extracts image files from *.docx containers.

Do you have images in a Word document? Need to get them out? doc-extract makes the process fast and simple. 

Place the doc-extract.bat file in the same directory as the target document(s). Run it and follow the prompts to select one or all documents. doc-extract will convert the file to a .zip, extract the "media" folder inside, and convert it back to a .docx when finished.
